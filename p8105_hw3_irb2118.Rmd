# Introduction
This Rmarkdown document is for P8105 - Data Science 1, homework 3, covering topics related to visualization and exploratory data analysis.

# Methods
The NY NOAA data for this assignment comes from the `p8105.datasets` package, which will be imported here along with the `tidyverse` package. Additionally, some custom setup options are included here, based on Dr. Goldsmith's examples in class. Further datasets are available from the course website covering NHANES accelerometers and Citi Bike
```{r setup}
library(tidyverse)
library(p8105.datasets)

knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  fig.width = 6,
  fig.asp = .6,
  out.width = "90%"
)

theme_set(theme_minimal() + theme(legend.position = "bottom"))

options(
  ggplot2.continuous.colour = "viridis",
  ggplot2.continuous.fill = "viridis"
)

scale_colour_discrete = scale_colour_viridis_d
scale_fill_discrete = scale_fill_viridis_d
```
